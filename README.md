# social-network-api

As a social media startup, I want to create an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database so that 
my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. 

I enter the command to invoke the application that will get my server started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, after that the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

When the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia, then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and 
thoughts in my database

Once the API POST and DELETE routes are tested as well, I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add 
and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Installation
